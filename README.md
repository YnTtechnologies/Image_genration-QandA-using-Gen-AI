- Prototyping: Create mock-ups and test interfaces with generated images
- Information Retrieval: Get answers to a wide range of questions in real-time
- Educational Tool: Use the QA system as a learning aid

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras (for GAN)
- Streamlit (for user interface)
- Google's Generative AI (Gemini Pro model)
- dotenv (for environment variable management)
- GitHub (for version control and collaboration)

## Usage

### Image Generation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure dependencies are installed, including Python, TensorFlow, and Keras.
3. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook or upload it to Google Colab.
4. Run the notebook to train the GAN model and generate images.
5. GPU acceleration is recommended for efficient training.

### Question Answering
1. Set up the environment variables, including the Google Generative AI API key.
2. Run the Streamlit application:
3. Input your questions in the text field and submit to receive AI-generated answers.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of the image generation and question answering systems
- Deployment to cloud platforms for broader accessibility
- Addition of more AI models for enhanced capabilities
- Improved user interface with advanced styling and error handling
